===========================
All the assets remodeling done by Extzy#7956,
This mod has been created for SI Clan and dedicated to include our clan colors as part of items 
if you do not like it, you could remove the items from the pack and use the others
this is free to use, Please do not claim ownership of what you have not made :)
===========================
I have remodelled only the appeareans of the assets and not their Mini size,
this has been done on purpose so you will recognize the items when they drop
but enjoy the resesigned look of them when they are placed
===========================


#Installation
===========================
Click Settings>> Modify Assets
----------------------------------------
put all the items in folder .img to Tab /img/
And put all the items in folder img.item
into /img/item/
=========================================
Enjoy, and Be Aware of the Space Invaders  ';.;'
